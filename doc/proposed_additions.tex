\title{big TODO list and proposed additions}

\begin{document}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Complete basic features (bang from file, crunch to file, grab known configs from system, search for configs based on program prefix e.g. vim is installed, look for vim*, read config file and change execution based on that i.e. include and exclude).
        \item Different built in options for the config file such as exclude family xserver (to exclude family of packages) vs. exclude package suckless_tools or something which just excludes the one as well as things like exclude_window_managers or exclude_X_all to exclude window manager related packages/configs or X related packages respectively.  Include/exclude should override with increased specificity (i.e. if they say include this package, it overrides exclude this family)
        \item Extensibility: allow users to add on to the existing program without needing to fork the project or mess with the source.
    \end{enumerate}
